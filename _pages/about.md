Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a 4th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Bologna. My supervisor 
is professor [Matteo Barigozzi](https://www.barigozzi.eu/Home.html). 

My research field is Econometrics, with particular focus on Factor Models, both theoretically and empirically. My current research focuses on:
<ul>
  <li>Theory and practice of non-stationary dynamic factor models.</li>
  <li>Assessment of the Euro Area business cycle, and of Euro Area growth at risk.</li>
  <li>Asymmetric effects of Euro Area monetary policy.</li>
  <li>Estimation of time-varying Phillips Curve(s).</li>
</ul>

I am currently in Madrid, until March 2025, for my visiting period at the Statistics department of [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/statistics-department/home). Feel free to reach out!
